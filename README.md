# Equilibrium_Temp
===================
**Small helper for "climate-change-deniers"-conversations**

This small programm is for everybody who struggles with climate change deniers. I recognize they often argument with a false mean temprature values. To get an argument against them, I choose the namegiving equilibrium temperature. This temperature is achieved by stable star systems. But there is one problem, the formula exculdes the atmosphere and every effect of the atmosphere. If you use this formula for the earth you can recognize, that the equilibrium temprature is -18Â° C. The difference between this calculated temperature is not negligible. I am not a climatologist, but I am able to recognize the correlation between this temprature difference and the greenhouse effect in our atmosphere.

EXCLAIMER:
This small little project started with a newsfeed from the morning of 03.08.2019 and provoked me into writing some code, because using a calculator is often too complicated and time wasting for easy formulas. I know that many things in this code are not the way to go (using a dictionary for Planets a.e.). Many things I did were purely for exercise. If you want to improve that code, feel free to do it.
